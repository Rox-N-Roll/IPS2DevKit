# Foundations of a Layout 

The first and most important step of mapmaking for Ips2, if not any game is the layout. The layout should feel fresh and new, along with replicating and expanding on gameplay that works and is enjoyed in the current game.  Each room should be important or viable in its own way, such as providing a connection between 2+ areas, being the home-place to a mechanic or dropoff, or just being a vault-like room. (WIP)

# Loops

Layouts should essentially form one or multiple loops, or a big circular connection of rooms that allows for a good intertwined layout that doesnâ€™t rely on one room to reach every room (ie a hallway).

Examples of well made loops include: 

- Police station 2F > On PS, there is a fairly subtle yet commonly used loop between Cells > Hall > Evidence Room > Balcony > Cells, this loop is well designed and can be easily deviated from for any possible reason. The loop includes the balcony dropoff and can be expanded on to include the window dropoff aswell. The loop is well hidden with use of different setpieces and rooms such as Cells, and the Evidence Room. Ontop of this the loop feels natural as you are pushed into cells as the hall from the window dropoff ends, which in turn pushes you into the balcony. Thats why at times its hard to tell balcony is an entirely isolated hallway since it blends and weaves into its connecting rooms visually and gameplay wise incredibly well.

- Farm Full Map > The entirety of farm is one big well hidden loop, hidden solely via setpieces and different settings such as the Shop and Barn. Along with this is utilizes the farmhouse to create a shortcut between the loop to allow for flanks and breakpoints between looping. The loop in farm includes every dropoff, with the most convenient being Barn and River, all while still ensuring every location is a viable exit. All around a great loop gameplay wise and visually.

- Restaurant 1 & 2F loop > While not being utilized nearly as often as the first 2, restaurant still has the ability to loop around the map in a continuous circle, with a fair amount of break points and areas to deviate from the loop. On the first floor you can loop from the break room to the garage, back to the break room, going through all of the staff segments along with passing by the freezer and staircase. The second floor has a significantly more linear loop, although still being hidden by the setpiece of the lounge. On the second floor there are many ways to deviate and leave the loop. The only major issue with the 2nd floor loop being how the seating areas can feel a tad bit like hallways gameplay wise, but this is solved by having the break points and stairs at either ends of halls, along with having a fair share of items to boot.

- Complex APTS > In Complex there is the upper floor loop which weaves inbetween apartments and other various setpieces such as the construction and elevator room. The loop itself has 2 dropoffs along with having a minor shortcut within the loop. Small issues with this loop is the lack of easy breakaway from the loop unlike the PS loop, with the major places to deviate from the loop being the Lounge, Construction, and Elevator rooms being the only places. The loop is well hidden in the scenery via several different ways of hiding entrances / exits to rooms in a natural way that makes each area flow into the next, all around making it a fairly hidden loop. 

# Layout No-Gos

- At all costs avoid straight hallways, along with T halls. These are brutal for players and overpowered for cameras, along with not having much room for creative item placement or unique gameplay.

- Avoid rooms with one way in, one way out. Rooms like these make it so a thief is trapped in whenever a camera is in the same room, as as-long as the camera patrols the one door the thief will not have any way in, or out without being spotted (Basically a choke point).

(this is heavy WIP)
