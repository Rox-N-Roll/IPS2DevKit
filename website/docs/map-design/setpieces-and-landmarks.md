# Setpieces and Landmarks

Layouts should also include stand-out locations that fit the map thematically, rooms like these are recognizable and different so that when seen the player will know where they are and ideally what is around them, along with making the map memorable and unique. 

# Examples: 

- Cells (Police Station) > Police station’s essential loop includes this room, along with it standing out visually it is also between 2 dropoffs, making it one of the most passed through and essential rooms of the map. Alternatively the Evidence Room could be listed here.

- Dining room (Mansion) > Mansion has a lot of stand-out rooms, this is one of them. Being an essential walking path along with having a dropoff and two camera spawns, just about every player will enter this room at one point in the game.

- Construction room (Complex) > This room is an essential walking path connecting the main loop of the apartments into the jewelry store, along with this it is surrounded by 2 dropoffs and 2 separate exits / entrances into the apartment loop. Visually this room is different than the rest of the apartments to signify it’s importance.

- Break Room (Restaurant) > The break room is an essential walking path in restaurant, having a dropoff in and nearby along with easy access to the freezer and upper lounge. The break room also leads directly into the frontrooms in restaurant along with the backrooms, making it a perfect inbetween and memorable location on the map.

- Break Room (Bank) > The break room in bank looks visually unremarkable, however it makes up for this by being one of the most essential rooms in all of ips2 map design. It directly connects into two hallways which lead into the vault and staircase, all while being surrounded by 3 dropoffs. This room is passed in by every player numerous times every time bank is played.

- Frontroom OR Jewelry Store (Mall) > The frontroom of mall is the most expansive and open area in IPS2 history, standing out for being multi leveled with a brutal lack of cover. The building in the frontroom makes it stand out visually along with connecting the entirely of mall together. The second notable landmark would likely be the jewelry store, sporting a darker color palette which contrasts with the majority of the map and being surrounded by two dropoffs. The room itself has no connections (one way in one way out) but making up for it by being a vault-styled room (expensive items but fairly risky).

- Farmhouse (Farm) The farmhouse in farm is a stark contrast from the exterior area required to enter it, with lighter colors and a warmer feel. visually it is a good landmark being the centerpiece of the map, With it being the centerpiece it also allows as being a shortcut to cut through the main loop in farm which makes it a great option for quick escapes or a viable flank. Along with this it branches off into several rooms all with their own uses, such as the living room area being a good vault style room with its fair share of expensive items, bedroom being a good breakpoint and connection to the larger farmhouse, and the bathroom having the window exit along with it being a fairly balanced blindspot.
