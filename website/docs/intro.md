# Introduction

**FISH WINNER!** is a toolset for **[In Plain Sight 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/2901172949)** content development in the form of a Roblox Studio plugin and this documentation website. The plugin can insert utility dummies, assets for map development, and has a map linter to ensure maps comply with the proper format. This documentation website contains any and all information that would be needed to develop content for IPS2.

For map development in specific, usage of the plugin is critical. Submitted maps should match the required format in order to be accepted into the game.

More features will come to the plugin in the future to accelerate content development!
